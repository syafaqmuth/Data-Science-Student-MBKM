It’s a mobile puzzle game where the same colour tiles should be connected to clear the board and win the level. After crossing various levels, there are gates placed which are usually there to show users ads or act as a paywall to purchase the app.\n\n## **Problem**\n\nWe now consider the challenge of placing gates. Initially, the gate was placed on level 30, but what if we place the gate at level 40. There are chances the user might be interested to play more that is retention might increase for each player and increase the traffic for the mobile game but to be confident enough we should back up our conversion rates with a valid explanation or statistical analysis.\n\nWe perform A/B testing, to check if placing the gate at a different level leads to more retention. But first, start with Exploratory Data Analysis of the dataset to get a picture of what kind of data is and what it holds.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-10-21T05:43:58.412326Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-10-21T05:43:58.412813Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-10-21T05:43:58.45265Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-10-21T05:43:58.412717Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-10-21T05:43:58.451406Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"cc = pd.read_csv('../input/mobile-games-ab-testing-cookie-cats/cookie_cats.csv')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-10-21T05:43:58.45527Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-10-21T05:43:58.456228Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-10-21T05:43:58.558976Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-10-21T05:43:58.456179Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-10-21T05:43:58.557364Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"cc","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-10-21T05:43:58.560636Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-10-21T05:43:58.561193Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-10-21T05:43:58.598427Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-10-21T05:43:58.561142Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-10-21T05:43:58.597126Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"cc.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-10-21T05:43:58.602077Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-10-21T05:43:58.602986Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-10-21T05:43:58.617803Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-10-21T05:43:58.602915Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-10-21T05:43:58.616391Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The dataset contains 5 variables.
